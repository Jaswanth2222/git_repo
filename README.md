## This project is all about learning and practising Git

1. Open file Explorer => Go to folders like documents, dwonloads(Basically in which folder you wan to create your project) => In the bread crumb, remove all the folder names and type cmd and click enter.

2. Now cmd prompt will be opened and clone the github remote repository to local with help of https link
  ==> cmd to type in cmd prompt is ** git clone <https link> ** and click enter.

3. The repository which we have cfreated intiially in github will be visible in on your folder and we can open this folder in your vs code

4. Initally there is only one branch(master) created in our project, we are not allowed to make any kind of changes in the "master" which is the top level branch. So we need to create second level branch called "develop" and we are not allowed to use develop as our branch directly. Based on the feature we need to create a branch and after the completion of that feature we need to merge that in to develop based on few approvals.

 ==> cmd to check the number of branches created in our prject ** git branch **
 ==> command to create branch *** git checkout -b <brnchname> *** Eg : git checkout -b develop
